<p class="slogan">
	In context of how DiamondPHP implements blocks (a.k.a. partial views), it is best described as any chunk of data that is generated and displayed independent of the template management -- in other words, which isn't contained in a Smarty .tpl file. To gain a clearer understanding, lets view an example contained within the framework, the signup page.
