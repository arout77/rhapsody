        No need for complex setup and endless configuration. Most people will be up and running in 5 minutes or less!
    </p>
    <strong>1. Download the framework</strong>
    <p>
        Download DiamondPHP framework from one of our repositories:<br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/arout77/diamondphp">GitHub repo for DiamondPHP</a></li>
            <li>
                <strike><a href="https://bitbucket.org/arout77/diamondphp/src/master/">Bitbucket repo for DiamondPHP</a></strike> (Bitbucket repository is currently inactive and only remains for historical purposes. DO NOT USE!)
            </li>
        </ul>
        Once the download is complete, copy the package to the location you wish to install the framework (typically, the root directory of your web server). Unzip the package.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once all the files are unpacked, open a terminal (command prompt for Windows users) and change to the directory where you just unzipped the framework:<br><br><span class="terminal">cd /path/to/install/directory</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Run the following command:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="terminal">composer update</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Composer will then create a folder named "vendor", and download and install any files the framework requires. To view what packages Composer is installing, simply open the <code>composer.json</code> file located in the root directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="alert alert-info-light">
            Composer needs to be available in your global path in order to run. If you are unable to run the <code>composer</code> command, please visit the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/" target="_blank">Composer installation page</a>.
        </div>
    </p>

    <strong>3. Edit the configuration file</strong>
    <p>
        Located in the root directory, you will find a configuration file named <code>.env.example</code>. Rename this file to <code>.env</code>, and then open it in a text editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will find that most of the settings are blank, and a few are already filled out. For more information regarding these settings, view the <a href="{$smarty.const.SITE_URL}documentation/introduction/configuration" target="_blank">configuration documentation</a>. Some of the settings are optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="alert alert-warning-light">
            There are some settings that are mandatory:<br>
            Database settings, site URL, time zone and all of the settings that already contain a default value (you may change these if you wish). This information is <strong>not</strong> collected in any way by us, but is necessary for the proper operation of various framework features.
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>If you are installing the framework in the root directory of your server, installation is complete! You may now continue using the framework.</strong>
    </p>
    <p><h5 class="red">If you are installing the framework to a sub-directory, you will need to modify the following files</h5></p>

    <strong>4. Installing to a sub-directory</strong>
    <p>
        To complete installation in a subdirectory, you will need to update the .env and .htaccess files. <br>
        First, update the RewriteBase rule in the provided .htaccess file in the root directory. Change the following line: <code>RewriteBase /</code> to <code>RewriteBase /name-of-your-subdirectory/</code>.
        <br>Next, in the .env file located in the same directory as the .htaccess file, find <code>subdir = ""</code> (around line 82), and insert the name of your subdirectory in the quotes.
        
        <br><br>Congratulations, installation is now complete!
    </p>
    <div>
    <h4>Note</h4>
        If, after installation, you experience any issues or see a blank white page, re-open the <code>.env</code> configuration file, run the system startup check:<br>
        <code>system_startup_check = "TRUE"</code><br>
        This will look for any common environment issues that may cause errors. Address any issues that it may have indicated, and then re-run the startup check, until no further issues are found. At that point, turn the startup check back off: <br><code>system_startup_check = "FALSE"</code><br>
        If you are still experiencing problems even after the startup check finds no issues, turn on error reporting and error logging in the <code>.env</code> configuration file. Any errors or exceptions should then be displayed in your browser, as well as logged in the <code>system.log</code> file, located in <em>/var/logs</em>.<br><br>
        <p><em>A common issue may be with server file permissions, preventing the framework from reading or writing to important files (especially the Smarty template engine and it's cache directories). If this is the case, the framework likely cannot log the errors to the system logger either. Ensure that all folders have file permissions set to 0755 and all files have write permission 0644.</em></p>
